    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p class="p3">Hi there, My name Alexa Kemp
        Welcome to my first website that I designed for my intro to Computer Science class that I'm taking at Lewis University 
        I am a first generation flyer here at Lewis. I have two younger brothers and a younger sister and an adorable 7 year old 
        Bichon Shizu dog. Never like to be bored so I always try to fill my life with creative and fun things to do. I love to 
        read when I can; one of my favorite novels is And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. I taught myself to paint and 
        draw from a young age and still love to sketch even though I'm not that great at it. I have found a true love for running
        and I have been dedicated the sport for almost 5 years now. My senior year of high school I invested a lot of my time into 
        my engineering electives that wanted to try out. I soon entered into the extra curricular competitions for engineering.
        My first competion my team came in 4th and my second competition was for a state recognized competition called IDEA and 
        my team fulfiled the requirements for competition of creating a vending machine for 25 dollars and won first place at 
        regionals and were promising contendors for state except it got cancelled and now I am here looking into engineering as 
        my possible future career.

    <p class="p4">
        Like I said in my introduction, I like to keep busy so I tend to have an abounce of things I like to do 
        in my spare time. I like to paint and read; both are really calming and imaginative outlets for me. I like to 
        learn and watch documentaries, movies too. Napping is definetly an all time favorite. However, if I had to pick what 
        I loved to do most it would be running. I fell in love with racing and training when I first started to get the hang
        of it in high school. I remember some rough days in high school would really get me down and i would always feel better 
        after seeing my teammates and going for a nice run with them with our favorite playlist playing. Running just makes me 
        feel good about myself and proud that I put in work to make myself healthier. It also really clears my head of all the 
        troubles that go on throughout my everyday life.
